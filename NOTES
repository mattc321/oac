enumerate motionsoft members
get members of a certain type? Active I would image?
pull full memeber
sync basic fields, name, address, phone, member since, active status, total annual revenue
create reverse method to update motionsoft. I believe they dont offer this?
see if hubspot has webhooks
If they do, expose an endpoint to update motionsoft
